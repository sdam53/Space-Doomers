I made it so that it is really easy to find the bounds and buffer for each animation. Though you will have to deal with setting up multiple files for queue.

Every png file for animation will have a x start of 0 and a y start of 0 with a buffer of 0.
The only difference is their width, height, and frame count which I'll will be giving below. This should make it much easier for you.

front death: 369x454px 18 frames
front idle: 280x339px 25 frames
front run: 299x343 16 frames
left idle: 271x339 25 frames
left run: 280x346 16 frames
right idle: 271x339 25 frames
right run: 280x346 16 frames
back idle: 293x338 25 frames
back run: 299x342 16 frames

Note that they are pretty large sprites so when you input their scale. do something like PARAMS.SCALE * .3 or less
They also have a lot of frames so make their frame time something like .1 or less
